Authorization Write-Up

The process of verifying an individual's identity is called authentication. It is often confused with authorization,
but the two concepts serve different purposes. Authorization occurs after authentication and determines what a person is 
allowed to access or do within a system. This step is crucial because it safeguards privacy and establishes clear rules for 
user behavior. For example, when logging into a social media account, the platform first requests a username or verification
code to confirm your identity. After authentication, authorization decides what actions you can take with that account. 
Authorization can be implemented in various ways. Role-based Access Control (RBAC) assigns persmissions based on predefined
roles, such as viewer, editor, or administrator, making it easier to manage employee privileges and restrictions. Another 
method is Access Control List (ACLs), which specify the users or groups that can access a particular resource. Together,
authentication and authorization work hand in hand to ensure IT environments remain secure and well-regulated.
